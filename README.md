# Celeberity Face Image Generation using DCGAN

Welcome to our project! ðŸ¤—ðŸš€ In this repository, we will guide you through creating fake celebrity faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) with PyTorch. Using a large collection of images featuring famous individuals, our system will learn how to create new, realistic-looking "celebrity" portraits.

This exciting endeavor combines deep learning techniques with image processing and data visualization tools. Here are some highlights:

## Key Technologies & Libraries Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* PyTorch
* sci-kit-learn
* seaborn
* matplotlib

## Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
At the heart of our project lies GAN technology. A GAN consists of two networksâ€”a generator and a discriminator. Our goal is for the generator network to transform random noise into convincing photographs indistinguishable from those found within the original dataset. To achieve this outcome, both networks engage in an adversarial process where each competes against the other during training. This competition ultimately leads to highly sophisticated generated images.
